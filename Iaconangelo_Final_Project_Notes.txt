Filtered NYC OpenData for Agency Name (Department of Housing Presrvation and Development), created date (between 08/01/2015 12am and 08/31/2015 12PM) and Incident Zip (11221).

Created an Excel file with data in place.  Think I'll look at the kind of complaint, the way it was resolved, and the descriptor of the problem.

I made a pivot table with the Complaint Type as the column and the Resolution Description as the row.  There were 479 complaints logged in the month of August in total, including complaints which are still open.  The most common complaint by far is of "Unsanitary Condition".  

Dragging "Resolution Description" into the Column category makes it easier to see the totals for each category. 

99 of the 479 complaints are of Unsanitary Conditions.  That seems quite high to me.  
In 35 of those instances, the Dept was "not able to gain access to inspect the following conditions" -- and so they closed the complaint!
In 40 of those instances, the Dept inspected the conditions and decided not to issue a violation, then closed the complaint.
In 15 of those instances, the Dept inspected it and issued a violation.

The other most common categories of complaints were Heat/Hot Water (60), Door/Window (51), Paint/Plaster (49), and Plumbing (46).
I think probably the most newsy of these are Unsanitary; Heat/Hot Water; and Paint/Plaster.  

Filtering under "Column Labels", I find that 25 of the 60 Heat/Hot Water complaints were actually duplicates -- someone had already reported it.

Paint/Plaster, Dept not able to gain access to inspect -- and closed the complaint -- on 10 of the instances.
Paint/Plaster -- Dept inspected and issued a violation in 19 of the 49 instances.
Paint/Plaster -- Dept inspected and issued no violations in 13 of the 49 instances.

For Plumbing -- Dept not able to gain access, and closed complaints -- 27 out of the 46 times.
Plumbing -- Dept inspected and issued violations in 12 of the times.
Plumbing -- dDept inspected and issued no violations on 7 of the instances.

I imagine that they probably aren't able to get access on so many of the Plumbing and Unsanitary Conditions cases because they're occurring inside someone's apartment, and maintenance probably doesn't have the right to just walk in if no one opens up.

Now I'm running another pivot table, with Street Name and Address in the rows and the complaint type in the columns.  
Forgot to note earlier that this is restricted to 11221 zip code, which encompasses most of Bushwick and part of Bed-Stuy.  

The idea behind this pivot table is to figure out what complexes and what addresses are repeat offenders.  

Some repeat offenders: 441 Wilson (with 25 complaints); 920 Madison with 22; and 490A Jefferson with 22.
